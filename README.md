GEOSTATISTICS 

The directory \Predicting_RGB_Image_Hues_Kriging_and_KNN contains MATLAB codes for the final project in a geostatistics course

This project involved a comparison between Kriging (gaussian process regression) methods and the K-nearest neighbors algorithim for predicting spatial data given a small number of sampling points.

A 3 channel (red, geen and blue intensities) image of a hamburger is sampled a small number of times. theses sampling points are used with both esitmation methods. 

The project report is included as a .pdf file (project_report_Banks_GEOL791_Geostatistics.pdf)

The script 'KNN_predictions' can be run to see some example results for predictions using k-nearest neighbors algorithim. 

The script 'Kriging_predictions' can be run to see some example results for predictions using a universal kriging algorithim.

The codes in the folder \supprt_codes were acquired online and handle the kriging predictions.
